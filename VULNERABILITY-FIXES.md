# Vulnerability Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to address npm vulnerabilities in the Threat Dragon project.

## Vulnerabilities Addressed

1. **High Severity**: `cross-spawn < 6.0.6` - ReDoS vulnerability
   - Dependency Path: `yorkie` → `execa` → `cross-spawn` → `@vue/cli-plugin-eslint`
   - Fix: Added package override for cross-spawn to use version ^7.0.3

2. **Moderate Severity**: `postcss < 8.4.31` - Line return parsing vulnerability
   - Dependency Path: `@vue/component-compiler-utils` → `postcss` → `@vue/cli-service`
   - Fix: Added package override for postcss to use version ^8.4.31

3. **High Severity**: `ws 8.0.0 - 8.17.0` - DoS vulnerability with HTTP headers
   - Dependency Path: `puppeteer-core` → `ws` → `webdriverio` → `@wdio/cli`
   - Fix: 
     - Short-term: Added package override for ws to use version ^8.17.1
     - Long-term: Started migration from WebdriverIO to Cypress for desktop testing

## Implementation

### Package Overrides

Added the following overrides to the root `package.json`:

```json
"overrides": {
  "libxmljs2": "0.30.0",
  "http-errors": "2.0.0",
  "cross-spawn": "^7.0.3",
  "postcss": "^8.4.31",
  "yorkie": "npm:husky@^7.0.0",
  "@vue/component-compiler-utils": "^3.3.0",
  "ws": "^8.17.1",
  "puppeteer-core": "^22.12.0"
}
```

### WebdriverIO to Cypress Migration

Started the migration from WebdriverIO to Cypress for desktop Electron testing:

1. Created Cypress configuration for Electron desktop testing (`e2e.desktop.config.js`)
2. Added Electron-specific support in Cypress (`tests/e2e/support/desktop.js`)
3. Migrated WebdriverIO tests to Cypress format (`tests/e2e/desktop/desktop.cy.js`)
4. Updated npm scripts to use Cypress for desktop testing
5. Preserved the WebdriverIO configuration temporarily for reference

### Code Improvements

During the vulnerability fixing process, we also:

1. Improved code quality in server components:
   - Reduced function complexity in app.js, auth.js, and google.js
   - Fixed ESLint issues such as max-lines-per-function
   - Improved error handling in auth controller
   - Added proper Unicode regex flag usage
   - Ensured all tests continue to pass without skipping any

2. Added comprehensive documentation:
   - Created migration documentation in MIGRATION.md
   - Added README for desktop testing
   - Created this vulnerability fixes summary

## Verification

- Confirmed all production dependencies are vulnerability-free with `npm audit --omit=dev`
- All server tests pass with `npm run test:server`
- Server code passes linting with `npm run lint:server`

## Next Steps

1. Complete the migration from WebdriverIO to Cypress for desktop testing
2. Fully remove WebdriverIO dependencies once migration is validated
3. Add regular dependency vulnerability scans to CI pipeline
4. Monitor for any new vulnerabilities in dependencies
